Out of respect for your time, my name is Maria Ramos. Born in Lisbon,
Portugal, but my late parents emigrated to South Africa when I was 6
years old. I am a businesswoman, banker, and corporate executive.
Kindly, you can research me to know more about me if you will. I know
this may come to you as a surprise because you do not know me, but I
need your trust and assistance urgently because of my present health
condition - I am suffering from cancer (a long-term illness). I desire
to have a genuine working relationship with you. 

I am requiring your help to help me carry out my last wish of
distributing my funds to various charitable organizations around you. I
deposited the sum of USD 2.5M (Two million, Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars) with a finance/bank in South Africa where I reside now.
I have worked hard and donated to many charitable organizations in my
community and neighboring countries. However, I want to help across
international borders too as God directs me before I pass on. 

This inspiration was sparked after watching a YouTube video about Jon
Huntsman of the USA, who survived cancer multiple times and donated
endlessly to the cancer issue. He contributed over a billion United
States dollars of his money towards helping the less privileged all over
the world. 

Suffering from this cancer; my doctor informed me that due to my poor
health condition, I would not be able to stay alive past the next few
months. Knowing my condition, I decided to donate these funds to
charitable organizations in your country. I prayed about this, and I
have confidence in my decision. 

Please reply and inform me if you can help with my last wish. I will
compensate you and your family for your efforts by 50% of the $2.5M.
Thank you for your attention, and I anticipate your earliest response. 

Kindly reply to me here: Msmariar6@gmail.com 

Sincerely,
Ms. Maria Ramos.
Help around the World to me is the Greatest Investment.
